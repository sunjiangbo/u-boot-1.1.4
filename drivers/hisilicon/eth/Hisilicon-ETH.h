 * This program is loaded into SRAM in bootstrap mode, where it waits
 * for commands on UART1 to read and write memory, jump to code etc.
 * A design goal for this program is to be entirely independent of the
 * target board.  Anything with a CL-PS7111 or EP7211 should be able to run
 * this code in bootstrap mode.  All the board specifics can be handled on
 * the host.
